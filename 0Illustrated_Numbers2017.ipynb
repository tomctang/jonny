The Python developers have worked hard to make Python run fast -- built-in operations like `**` will almost certainly be faster than any function that you write with a loop in Python.  The developers have written programs in the **C programming language** (typically) to implement operations like `**` (see the [CPython implementation](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c7163a7f7cd2/Python/bltinmodule.c#l1505), if you wish); their programs have been **compiled** into **machine code** -- the basic sets of instructions that your computer understands (and that are not meant for people to understand).  When you call a built-in operation like `**`, Python just tells your computer to run the developers' optimized and **precompiled** machine code... this is very fast!  When you run your own loop, Python is basically converting the code to machine code \"on the fly\" and this is slower.\n",

While Diffie-Hellman is used for symmetric key cryptography (using the same key to encrypt and decrypt), the RSA protocol has two keys:  a **public key** that can be used by anyone for encryption and a **private key** that can be used by its owner for decryption.  \n",

    "\n",
    "From a practical standpoint, there are many challenges, and we just mention a few here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key generation:**  The person who constructs the private key $(p,q)$ needs to be careful.  The primes $p$ and $q$ need to be pretty large (512 bits, or 1024 bits perhaps), which is not so difficult.  They also need to be constructed **randomly**.  For imagine that Alice comes up with her private key $(p,q)$ and Anne comes up with her private key $(q,r)$, with the same prime $q$ in common.  Their public keys will include the numbers $N = pq$ and $M = qr$.  If someone like Arjen comes along and starts taking GCDs of all the public keys in a database, that person will stumble upon the fact that $GCD(N,M) = q$, from which the private keys $(p,q)$ and $(q,r)$ can be derived.  And this sort of disaster has happened!  Poorly generated keys were stored in a database, and [discovered by Arjen Lenstra et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/064.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security by difficulty of factoring:**  The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of obtaining the private key $(p,q)$ from the public key $(N,e)$.  Since $N = pq$, this is precisely the difficulty of factoring a large number $N$ into two primes (given the knowledge that it is the product of two primes).  Currently it seems very difficult to factor large numbers.  The RSA factoring challenges give monetary rewards for factoring such large $N$.  The record (2017) is factoring a [768-bit (232 digit) number, RSA-768](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-768).  For this reason, we may consider a 1024-bit number secure for now (i.e. $p$ and $q$ are 512-bit primes), or use a 2048-bit number if we are paranoid.  If quantum computers develop sufficiently, they could make factoring large numbers easy, and RSA will have to be replaced by a quantum-secure protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Web of Trust:**  Trust needs to begin somewhere.  Every time Alice and Bob communicate, Alice should not come up with a new private key, and give Bob the new public key.  For if they are far apart, how does Bob know he's receiving Alice's public key and not talking to an eavesdropper Eve?  Instead, it is better for Alice to register (in person, perhaps) her public key at some time.  She can create her private key $(p,q)$ and register the resulting public key $(N,e)$ with some \"key authority\" who checks her identity at the time.  The key authority then stores everyone's public keys -- effectively they say \"if you want to send a secure message to Alice, use the following public key:  (..., ...)\"  Then Bob can consult the key authority when he wishes to communicate securely to Alice, and this private/public key combination can be used for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as one might guess, this kicks the trust question to another layer.  How does Bob know he's communicating with the key authority?  The key authorities need to have their own authentication mechanism, etc..  One way to avoid going down a rabbithole of mistrust is to *distribute* trust across a network of persons.  Instead of a centralized \"key authority\", one can distribute one's public keys across an entire network of communicators (read about [openPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP)).  Then Bob, if he wishes, can double-check Alice's public keys against the records of numerous members of the network -- assuming that hackers haven't gotten to all of them!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, some implementations of RSA use a more centralized authority and others rely on a web of trust.  Cryptography requires a clever application of modular arithmetic (in Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and many other systems), but also a meticulous approach to implementation.  Often the challenges of implementation introduce new problems in number theory."

The input to `sha512` is a string of arbitrary length, and the output is a sequence of 512 bits.  Here in Python 3, we also must specify the Unicode encoding (`utf-8`) for the string to be hashed.  One can convert the 512 bits of hash into 64 bytes (512/8 = 64) which can be viewed as a 64-character string via ASCII.  This 64-byte string is called the *digest* of the hash.
