    "    - Our course is operator-centric, eg. spin systems, four operator identities, Schrödinger factorization and Dirac’s abstract methodology, angular momentum algebra (rotations, spherical harmonics)\n",

    "- M1: Be able to describe how the principle of superposition underlies wave-particle duality and use the quantum superposition of states to analyze properties of spin (Stern-Gerlach experiments) and light (one-, two-, and multiple slits and the Mach-Zehnder interferometer).\n",
    "- M2: Distinguish between events, alternative ways an event occurs, tagging, and measurement; be able to use the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics to describe these different phenomena and how they allow for delayed choice experiments.\n",
    "- M3: Describe how entanglement requires quantum mechanics to violate local realism and how experiments verify that this occurs.\n",
    "- M4: Explain how an interaction-free experiment allows for quantum seeing in the dark and the details of how such an experiment is carried out.\n",
    "- M5: Know the four fundamental operator identities of quantum mechanics (Leibniz rule, Hadamard lemma, exponential disentangling identity, and Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula), in all of their variants, and be able to use them in quantum calculations.\n",
    "- M6: Use the Schrödinger factorization method to solve bound-state energy eigenvalue problems (determining the energies algebraically) and couple it with the translation operator (or the subsidiary condition) to find the wavefunctions; explain why the energy levels are discrete and describe how to use the node theorem to verify completeness.\n",
    "- M7: Use quantum principles employed in the class to explain properties of hydrogen including how to use spectroscopy to measure its mass, the radius of the nucleus, how it is used in radio astronomy, and how the probability distribution of electrons are measured in momentum space.\n",
    "- M8: Use approximation methods of perturbation theory and the variational method to learn about quantum systems that cannot be solved exactly.\n",
    "- M9: Calculate how time evolution is employed to describe oscillatory motion of the simple harmonic oscillator and the rotational motion of a nuclear spin; be able to use the Trotter form of the time-ordered product.\n",
