    "    - When we convert the two-body problem into average and relative position and momentum, we find that the motion separates into the average motion which is that of a free particle, with no forces on it(effective mass being total mass) and the relative motion being the central potential(effective mass being reduced mass).\n",
    "    - But this doesn't work for a three body problem.\n",
    "    - We also found that the angular momentum also separates angular momentum of the centre of mass being the average angular momentum and the angular momentum relative to the mass.\n",
    "    - This is exactly the same as what we had in classical mechanics."

    "- How to detect single photons(photomultiplier tube)\n",
    "    - How it works\n",
    "        1. The photon strikes the photocathode releasing an electron into the tube. It is focused onto the first dynode directly below at a high potential(~100V).\n",
    "        1. The electron accelerates towards the dynode and hits it hard, ejecting some(~2-5) electrons from the surface.\n",
    "        1. This continues from around 20-30 stages.\n",
    "        1. The electrons hit the anode at the end, which detects the current.\n",
    "    - This is good enough, but there are also better detectors out there.\n",
    "- Noise\n",
    "    - When detecting single photons, there are a few sources of noise.\n",
    "    - It is not possible to create an environment where stray photons cannot enter the device. This noise can be reduced by removing extraneous light.\n",
    "    - The electrons are weakly binded to the photocathode and can be spontaneously \"boiled off\". This noise can be reduced by cooling the detector.\n",
    "    - Ionized matter can also enter the tube, sometimes coming the walls, and charged particles will accelerate towards the first dynode because it is at such a high potential.\n",
    "    - Another issue is the efficiency of the detector. Sometimes it doesn't emit an electron, or it fails to focuse onto a dynode.\n",
